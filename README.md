A little Background

I really liked the  Pyromancy modï»¿. And I thought they only fire magic, and so I decided to make a similar mod for ice magic, which is based on Pyromancy

What is is this ?

Cryomancy is a mod that adds a custom skill tree made by meh321 Custom Skill Framework where you can specialize your magic on frost based spells. But beware , the more you invest yourself in Cryomancy perks weaker you fire spells will be... 

You can access the skill tree by activating the [Custom Skill Tree] - Cryomancy item added to your inventory when you first load up the game.

Cryomancy Perk Tree use regular perk points. So you have to choose between vanilla Destruction Perk Tree or this to invest your  perks. And that's where the specialization aspect comes in. You have to sacrifice some of your talents so you can specialise on being a frost magic focused Cryomancer.
Cryomancy level will be synchronized with your destruction. Your Cryomancy skill level will be same level as your destruction. When you load up the first time and every time your destruction increases , they will be synchronized.

Im open for  ideas/improvements ... Tell me your suggestions. Im pretty new to modding.

You can access the skill tree by activating the [Custom Skill Tree] - Cryomancy item added to your inventory when you first load up the game.

Compatibility:

There shouldn't be any Compatibility issues. I didn't edit anything vanilla.
I only added new things perks , magic effects.

I made a mod for building skyrim, but there should be no problems, and if you suddenly have problems with leveling the cryomancy skill,
you can write in the console:

set CLM_CryomancyLevel to 100

-Mod was tested  on Skyrim se 1.5.97.0.8  and  Skyrim nolvus ascension 5.2.5.

I want to express my gratitude:

meh321 for his Excellent Custom Skill Framework
arkasiSari8 for his Pyromancy skill tree mod
